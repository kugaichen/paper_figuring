This repository is about creating the comfortable and clear figures for paper writing.
**(NOTE: all the data contained in code or figures are all simulated randomly.)**

Histogram_log2.py is to creat the bar chart with y-data illustrated in log2 format, the example result figure like this:
![Histogram_log2_result](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6da96089-fe00-41d1-a31c-1a9ba927d2bc)

Histogram_int.py is to creat the bar chart with y-data illustrated in Integer format, the example result figure like this:
![Histogram_int_result](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c4635eea-c3b8-42d7-b760-7554f1be60b0)

Histogram_with_Line_Plot.py generates a combined bar chart (histogram) and line plot in the same figure. This visualization is particularly useful for pairwise comparison, where:

- The bar chart (histogram) represents the distribution or categorical data.

- The line plot highlights trends, differences, or comparisons between the data points.

the example result figure like this:
![histogram_with_line](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9e0677d7-a38c-41b4-87f8-38861f92a905)
